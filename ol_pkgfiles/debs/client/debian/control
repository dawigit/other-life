Description: client package for Other Life, a free MMORPG 
 Other Life is a free to play, graphical MMORPG (massively-multi-player
 online role-playing game).  Different from other role-playing games, there are
 no fixed classes so you can improve any of the many skills.  There is a choice
 of several character races but all are equal. Other-Life is based on the
 Eternal Lands free MMORPG.
