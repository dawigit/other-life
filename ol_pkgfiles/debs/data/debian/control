Description: data package for Other Life, a free MMORPG
 Other Life is a free to play, graphical MMORPG (massively-multi-player
 online role-playing game).  Different from other role-playing games, there are
 no fixed classes so you can improve any of the many skills.  There is a choice
 of several character races but all are equal. Other-Life is based on the
 Eternal Lands free MMORPG.
 .
 NOTE: This package will download and install the Other Life data
 archive from twinmoons.org.uk.  This file is the same as the official
 release but hosted to ensure the package continues to work if the
 archive is moved or modified.
